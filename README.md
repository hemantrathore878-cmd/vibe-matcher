# AI Powered Vibe Matcher — Prototype

An AI-powered Vibe Matcher that converts short human “vibe” queries (like “energetic urban chic”) into semantic vectors and finds the top-3 matching fashion items with clear, human-friendly explanations.

# Project Contents
- vibe_matcher.ipynb — main notebook with all steps (data setup, embeddings, similarity search, reranking, MMR, and evaluation).
- products_dataset.csv — sample dataset of fashion products with names, descriptions, and vibe tags.
- test_query_results.csv — results file showing Precision@3, similarity scores, and latency for test queries.
- README_intro.txt — short text summary auto-generated by the notebook.

# working
1. Product descriptions are converted into Sentence-Transformer embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.
2. The user’s vibe query is also embedded into the same vector space.
3. Cosine similarity finds the most semantically similar products.
4. A hybrid reranker blends semantic similarity with lexical token overlap for better matching.
5. MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) ensures diversity among the top results.
6. Each selected product is explained in simple language — showing why it matched the given vibe.

# Evaluation
 Metrics used: Precision@3, Top-1 similarity (≥ 0.7 = strong match), and latency (in milliseconds).
 Results: Saved automatically as test_query_results.csv with bar chart visualizations for latency and similarity scores.
 Goal: Assess both the accuracy and speed of the vibe search pipeline.

# Key Features
- Semantic search using Sentence-Transformers
- Hybrid reranking (semantic + lexical)
- MMR for diversity in top results
- Explainable outputs for better transparency
- Works completely offline — no API keys required

# Innovations
- Hybrid re-ranker (semantic + lexical blend)
- MMR for diversity (avoid duplicate/near-duplicate picks)
- Explainability tokens (shows overlapping tokens)
- Simple per-session personalization (feedback loop)
- Colab + Gradio demo for human-friendly presentation

## How to run
1. Open vibe_matcher.ipynb in Google Colab or VS Code (Jupyter).
2. Make sure these packages are installed:
        'pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn matplotlib pandas'
3. Run the notebook from top to bottom.
4. Review generated CSVs and plots inside the notebook or in the cache folder.

# Future Improvements
- Integrate embeddings with a vector database (Pinecone / Weaviate / Redis-Vector).
- Add a cross-encoder reranker for higher precision.
- Build a Gradio-based web interface for live interaction.
- Implement user feedback loops for personalized recommendations.
